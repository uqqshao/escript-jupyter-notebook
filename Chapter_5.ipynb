    "Unfortunately, the wave equation belongs to a class of equations called **stiff** PDEs. These types of equations can be difficult to solve numerically as they tend to oscillate about the exact solution, which can eventually lead to a catastrophic failure. To counter this problem, explicitly stable schemes like the backwards Euler method, and correct parameterisation of the problem are required. \n",

    "The velocity $v$ that a wave travels in a medium is an important variable. For stability the analytical wave must not propagate faster than the numerical wave is able to, and in general, needs to be much slower than the numerical wave. For example, a line 100m long is discretised into 1m intervals or 101 nodes. If a wave enters with a propagation velocity of 100m/s then the travel time for the wave between each node will be 0.01 seconds. The time step, must therefore be significantly less than this. Of the order $10E-4$ would be appropriate. This stability criterion is known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition given by\n",

The wave equation relies on a spatial frequency, thus the sampling theorem in this case applies to the solution mesh spacing. This relationship confirms that the frequency content of the input signal directly affects the time discretisation of the problem.\n",

    "To accurately model the wave equation with high resolutions and velocities means that very fine spatial and time discretisation is necessary for most problems. This requirement makes the wave equation arduous to solve numerically due to the large number of time iterations required in each solution. Models with very high velocities and frequencies will be the worst affected by this problem."

If we define the source as a cosine input, then the wavlength of the input is equal to the radius of the source. Let this value be 5 meters. Now, if the maximum velocity of the model is $c=380.0ms^{-1}$, then the source frequency is $f_{r} = \\frac{380.0}{5} = 76.0 Hz$. This is a worst case scenario with a small source and the models maximum velocity. \n",

If we assume the model mesh is a square equispaced grid, then the sampling interval is the side length divided by the number of samples, given by $\\Delta x = \\frac{1000.0m}{400} = 2.5m$ and the maximum sampling frequency capable at this interval is $f_{s}=\\frac{380.0ms^{-1}}{2.5m}=152Hz$ this is just equal to the\n",

    "Observe that for each doubling of the number of nodes in the mesh, we halve the time step. If the source is placed at the center, it is $500m$ from the nearest boundary. With a velocity of $380.0ms^{-1}$, it will take $\\approx1.3s$ for the wavefront to reach that boundary. In each case, this equates to $100$,  $200$ and $400$ time steps. This is again, only a best case scenario, for true stability these time values may need to be halved and possibly halved again."
